                <p>Their is sometimes a friend or a teacher and nieghbor that ask me to help them with thier pc to fix it because of some faulty behaviour. so i fix it to them doing troubleshooting on software like installing and repairing it.</p>
                <p>dealing with them needs patience and understanding for both of us to understand each other. and if i fix thier pc they always give me foods, softdrinks and etc. i am also a photographer and videographer editor and sometimes i shoot them for thier assigments and projects.</p>
                <br>
                <p>dealing with different problems in a computer somtimes is good but thier are some problem that i cant fix maybe because my knowledge is not vast enough to accomodate such error. however i gain some learnings while doing such activity.</p>
